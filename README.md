# Ray’s Kitchen 

A fun personal project inspired by my best friend, who has always talked about wanting to open a restaurant.
This app imagines what his brand could look like online while giving me space to practice building with Next.js, React, and Tailwind.

## Overview

Ray’s Kitchen is a simple mock food-ordering application that allows users to:
	•	Browse a list of dishes
	•	Add meals to a cart
	•	View the total price of selected items
	•	See calories and additional details for each meal
	•	Experience a clean layout with a background video

This project is not meant to be a full restaurant system.
It’s a mixture of personal inspiration and a practice playground for frontend development.
